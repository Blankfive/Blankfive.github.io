			<p><b><i>Just Because You Can Doesn't Mean You Should</i></b></p>
			<p><b>KOSable Actions:</b> <i>(Override Proven Status, but don't kill every previously proven person with a knife)</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Walking past an unID'd body, carrying an unID'd body, or hanging a body</li>
				<li>Wearing a disguise</li>
				<li>Having a T weapon (AWP, AK, SG, anything silenced, knife, c4, jihad, radio, teleporter, anything purchasable in the T shop)</li>
				<li>Throwing a frag grenade</li>
				<li>Passing a decoy or radio placed by a traitor without destroying it. Note that similar-looking props do spawn in some maps and do not count for this rule</li>
				<li>Being in a T room</li>
				<li>Killing or KOSing someone who was innocent or a detective, KOSing someone who later becomes proven, includes KOSing the detective, or KOSing someone pre-round who winds up being the detective</li>
				<li>KOSing you, even pre-round</li>
				<li>Shooting at someone or damaging them (if someone is shooting a rifle, deagle or gsg at something a significant distance away, and the viewer can't discern what, it's still KOSable)</li>
				<li>Teleporting (exceptions include teleporting to the basement in 67th way, or to and from the Nether in Minecraft)</li>
				<li>Swinging a prop violently, damaging someone with a prop, prop pushing near a high ledge</li>
				<li>Throwing an incendiary grenade at someone, throwing a discombobulator near a high ledge</li>
				<li>Propsurfing is killable in the act (you may not KOS)</li>
				<li>Destroying or damaging the T tester or a health station</li>
				<li>Setting up props with the intent to kill someone, or in any way setting a trap that does not immediately kill someone (not Slayable)</li>
				<li>Being near a decoy or t-bought radio (not the one in the 67th way barn or the narrow bank hallway behind the booth) and not shooting it</li>
				<li>Following you after 3 consecutive warnings not to, spaced at least a second apart</li>
				<li>Doorblocking or impeding you after 3 consecutive warnings not to, spaced at least a second apart. This applies to mashing e, simply standing in someone's way in a manner that they can't get around you, or something like the jail cells in 67th way</li>
				<li>Moving an ID'd body the detective is trying to interact with after 3 or more warnings spaced at least 1 second apart</li>
				<li>Refusing to get tested when asked by a detective when given 3 warnings spaced a second apart in the vicinity of the tester (doesn't count if the offending party leaves the vicinity before the 3rd warning)</li>
				<li>Hiding/Throwing diamond/gold/clay/brick blocks into the ocean, t room or lava on minecraft b5</li>
				<li>Carrying a banana on moon (shooting it not KOSable, it disables it)</li>
				<li>Carrying or shooting a mine on whitehouse</li>
				<li>Carrying an explosive barrel toward someone</li>
				<li>Damaging bridges on rooftops, even pre-round</li>
				<li>Charging the axe or carrying the charged axe on rooftops, even pre-round</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Probable Cause:</b> <i>(KOS reasons where you didn't directly see someone doing something, but know 100% they're a traitor, or someone who committed a traitorous act)</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Finding a recently dead body and determining that only one person could have killed that player</li>
				<li>Being in the company of KOS'd people and not shooting them</li>
				<li>Catching someone in the act of a lie (lie must be on-topic and related to the active round)</li>
				<li>Seeing someone come out of a previously empty room or appear in a previously empty room after having watched the only innocent-accessible exits, suggesting the person had to have teleported in a traitorous manner</li>
				<li>Seeing someone in a location where they only could have teleported in a traitorous manner to get there that fast (67th way basement/etc. are exceptions)</li>
				<li>You may kill/kos anyone who isn't a detective in overtime (even proven innocents), but be wary of karma</li>
				<li>Having DNA from a T weapon or dead innocent/detective</li>
				<li>Coming out of an enclosed or isolated space where you find a c4</li>
				<li>Someone possessing information only a traitor or someone who committed KOSable acts would have access to</li>
				<li>If no one talks and no one responds to a livecheck, you can kill anyone you see</li>
				<li>If someone tells you or you and other person(s) you're the last living innocent(s), you can kill anyone you see except another person listed as last living inno</li>
				<li>Any other reason you can demonstrate in response to a report you knew 100% that someone is a traitor or committed a traitorous act. Just be wary of radios, disguisers and other stuff</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Mathematical Cause:</b> <i>(big brain)</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li>There is one T for every 4 players, rounded down.</li>
				<li>If there were 15 players to start the round, only one traitor has been recorded dead, and the only players listed as alive when you press tab are you, a proven and a detective, and 2 others, you have full reason to kill the other 2 players, but the detective and the proven don't.</li>
				<li>The detective and the proven should encourage you 3 to kill each other and shoot anyone who disobeys.</li>
				<li>If all but one player are proven (not just saying they are, having a legitimate reason), that one player should be KOSed.</li>
				<li>Unid'd bodies you don't ID and radar may also factor into this, but be careful, disguisers negate radar, and when someone who has killed other players is killed and ID'd, all the players they've killed become listed as dead even if their bodies aren't ID'd.</li>
				<li>There are too many cases to describe, just note 'mathematical cause' if you get reported for doing this.</li>

			<h1>Callout Handguide "Chapter 2: the handguidening"</h1>
			<b><p>Exceptions to the Above:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Detective is above KOSable offenses. Killing or KOSing the detective while they are detective (this rule does not apply to KOSing someone who later becomes a detective pre-round) as an innocent when the detective has not committed a Slayable offense prior is Slayable.</li>
				<li>You cannot KOS someone for doing what you or a detective told them to do (this includes KOSing, instructing someone to destroy a health station or tester, etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<b><p>Added Note:</b> If a detective commits a Slayable action, or if an innocent commits a Slayable/KOSable action resulting in someone retaliating, the first person to commit a Slayable/KOSable action is liable for RDM if they inflict damage on another party as a result of this.</p>
			<b><p>'Vicinity' means:</b></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The tester room in community pool</li>
			<li>Anywhere on the tester side of the water trap in 67th way</li>
			<li>The tester room, immediately surrounding hallway, and the 2 rooms near the T room adjacent to the tester</li>
			<li>The tester building in moon.</li>
			<li>In minecraft b5, anywhere on the level that the testing cabin is on. Starts as soon as you top the ladder.</li>
			</ul>
			<b><p>Suspicion:</b> Call 'suspicion' or 'high suspicion' or any derivative anytime you want for whatever reason you want. It's basically 'I can't legally KOS this person but I want to.'</p>
			<p><b>Reasons to be Considered Proven:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Killing a traitor (delivering the decisive shot) or being the first one to KOS a traitor. KOSing a dead traitor just because no one KOSed him doesn't count.</li>
				<li>Being confirmed innocent by a traitor tester</li>
				<li>Calling a detective to a detective or traitor body, resulting in the detective finding credits on said body, or being the person to ID a detective or traitor body that a detective later finds credits on said body</li>
				<li>Dying, being ID'd innocent, then being revived</li>
				<li>Being attacked by a traitor (includes a person successfully being hit by a T trap, or damaged by a traitor).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have not witnessed someone become proven, you may only recognize them as proven for other purposes if the detective or someone you have witnessed become proven recognizes them as proven. If a large enough number of people call each other proven that it's mathematically impossible they're all traitors, you may also recognize this.</p>

				<li>If you KOS someone without a valid reason, and they later take damage due to your KOS, you are effectively liable for RDM.</li>
				<li>If you damage someone without a valid reason, you are effectively liable for RDM.</li>
				<li>Attempted is the same as successful. Staff members should err on the side of mercy and give the minimum amount of slays for accidental attempted RDM, however.</li>

			</ul>
			<b><p>Added Notes:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Racism/sexism/homophobia/hate speech/etc. is allowed as long as it isn't directed at a non-staff member who uses the server, discussing sexually explicit subject matter isn't. Feel free to go to pretty much any other server where that's allowed.</li>
				<li>**On-topic only when alive during round clause** gags/mutes encouraged to be used liberally when a staff member declares this, but these are not to be regarded as punishment. To be declared only when on-topic discussion can't be heard.</li>
